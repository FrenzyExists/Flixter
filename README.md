# Lab 3: NY Times Bestselling Books

## Overview

Youâ€™ve been asked by NY Times to design a simple app to see the current best selling books of the week, based on their website:

Their developers have already created some foundation for the app, but the networking isn't working and it doesnâ€™t look very good so far. This is a big job, so you'll have to apply all your skills in Layouts, RecyclerView, and API calls!

## Required Features

The core requirements are to create an app that allows the user to scroll through a list of books. They should be able to see the book's ranking, cover, title, author, and description.

## Stretch Features

The formatting and layout of the app have been improved, using View styling to better match the NY Times website. The "buy" button opens the book's Amazon listing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

By the end of this lab you will be able to...

- Request data from an API
- Parse data into a Kotlin model
- Bind data to View objects
- Style Views and arrange them using ConstraintLayout

## Application Features

### Required Features
- Live data is loaded from the NY Times API
- Books are displayed using a RecyclerView
- Book cover images are downloaded and displayed using Glide

### Stretch Features

The stretch features will help develop this app into something closer to the NY Times website.

- View elements are styled in the .xml files
- The "Buy" button successfully opens the page on Amazon

### Starter Code explanation

- BestSellerBook - the model representing a single book
- BestSellerBooksFragment - the fragment for our app, responsible for the networking
- BestSellerBooksRecyclerViewAdapter - the adapter for the RecyclerView, responsible for connecting the Views with the models
- MainActivity - the starting point for the code, creates a BestSellerBooksFragment
- OnListFragmentInteractionListener - an interface used by the RecyclerView adapter
